Motivation
This is to gain experience using JQuery and Javascript and Bootstrap.

How to Play
There are 4 different players you can chose to play. Each player differs in attack strength and counter-attack-strength.
    1. Select player to play, the unchosen players become enemies.
    2. Select defender from list of enemies. 
    3. Press the Attack button to launch an attack until one player dies. The attacker's attack points go up after each attack. The defender launches a counter attack. Attacks deduct from the players health scvcore.
    4. The game ends when health score goes below zero for your character, or your character defeats all the enemies.
